**Author : Bob Dylan**

How many roads must a man walk down   &nbsp; &nbsp; 一个人要走过多少路

Before they call him a man   &nbsp; &nbsp; 才能被称为真正的人

How many years can some people exist  &nbsp; &nbsp; 一只白鸽要飞过多少片大海

Before they‘re allowed to be free  &nbsp; &nbsp; 才能在沙丘安眠

......

How many times can a man turn his head  &nbsp; &nbsp; 一个人要回转过多少次头

And pretend that he just doesn‘t see   &nbsp; &nbsp; 才能假装什么都没看见

The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind   &nbsp; &nbsp;答案啊 我的朋友 在风中飘扬

The answer is blowing in the wind    &nbsp; &nbsp; 这答案飘扬在风中

How many times must a man look up   &nbsp; &nbsp; 一个人要仰望多少次

Before he can see the sky   &nbsp; &nbsp; 才能望见天空

How many ears must one man have

Before he can hear people cry

How many deaths will it take

Till he knows that too many people have died

The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind

The answer is blowing in the wind
